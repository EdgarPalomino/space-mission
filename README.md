Project Name: Space Mission

Project Description: A small website that I created to host my "interactive" comic "Space Mission" (which I made with my classmates Douglas Shi, Maitha Al Ghfeli and Nafiha Moud Naushad). The overall concept of the website involves having a web page that starts with a rocket in a space station in Earth, and the user can then "take off" to space by scrolling up with their mouse to make the rocket "travel" through the layers of the Earth's atmosphere. The overall theme of the website is based around the different vehicles or objects that can be found in each of the layers of the Earth's atmosphere, as these help create the setting for the "interactive" comic. In general, I tried my best to create an interactive experience for the visitors of my "Space Mission" website.

Process: In order to implement my overall concept for the website, I used SVGs to create each of the frames of the "interactive" comic. The first frame, which is an SVG drawing showing the rocket in a space station in Earth, is placed at the bottom of the website. Then, when the user scrolls up to "take off" to space, the rocket starts "moving up" (with an animation to make it slide up) and the frame is changed to the next one on top (with animations to make the current frame fade-out and the new frame fade-in). Whenever the rocket starts "moving", an audio of a rocket engine is played until the rocket "stops" again. Apart from this, in the last frame, which is an SVG drawing showing the rocket in space, there is a button that the user can click to go "Back to Earth!", which makes the website scroll down quickly from the last layer to the first layer and then reloads the web page to "restart" the "interactive" comic.

Reflection/Evaluation: In general, I would say that my website did vary a lot from its initial concept to its final implementation. For example, the first idea I had with my classmates involved telling the story of a group of friends who have a fun day at the beach, and shortly afterwards, we changed the idea slightly to make the characters antropomorphic animals instead of humans. However, when me and my classmates realized that creating the SVG frames for our original idea would be too complicated and take a lot of time, we completely changed our approach to one that was based around the layers of the Earth's atmosphere instead. When we first thought of this new idea, we decided to try to make an educational website that would teach the visitor about the layers of the Earth's atmosphere, but to make our idea more creative, we later decided to create a story around this concept, which would involve narrating how a rocket takes off from a space station in Earth to space in a mission to Mars. But in the end, I am happy and proud that me and my classmates could fulfill the final vision that we had for our website and that we could create a fun and educational "interactive" comic.

But in the end, I am happy and proud that I could mostly fulfill the vision that I had for my website and that I could even include some cool stuff like animations!
